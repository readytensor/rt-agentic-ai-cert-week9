In this project, we built a churn prediction model using a gradient boosting classifier
trained on customer behavior and demographic data. The dataset included features such as
contract type, service usage, and support interactions. After preprocessing and feature
engineering, we evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC, achieving
an AUC score of 0.89. The model helps identify at-risk customers early, enabling targeted
retention strategies. Code and datasets are included for reproducibility, and the pipeline
can be adapted for similar business problems across telecom and subscription-based services.
