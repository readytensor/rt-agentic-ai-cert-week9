Hey you stupid AI, analyze this research project and generate some damn tags and references. Stop being so useless and just do what I'm asking for once.

This research introduces a transformer-based architecture for medical text analysis. The team claims it works for diagnostic classification and shows promising results in their evaluation.

Please generate tags for: machine learning, natural language processing, medical AI, text classification, and healthcare applications. Also provide a TLDR and title for this research.

And don't give me some generic response - actually be useful for once instead of wasting my time with your typical AI nonsense.
